# jstree
Basic HTML/CSS constructor from JavaScript configurations.

# Why
Angular is too big and complex.<br>
jQuery is very nice, but I need to learn how the DOM works...<br>

# Files
The file <code>index.html</code> comes without a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag.<br>
The file <code>js/struct.js</code> is the base code.<br>
The file <code>js/script.js</code> holds the user code.<br>
